      "✅ Trip Verified | There was no blanket and no earphones, it looks like they ran out of them, in fact I saw that they distributed them up to a couple of rows in front of me, and because it was cold I had to use my own scarf instead. The food was very poor and of bad quality. Thankfully they offer a lot or beverages. For a long-distance flight is not acceptable that even in the economy class is the space for each seat too narrow. So given the tickets’ price it would be expected better services, that were not offered.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "✅ Trip Verified | Our flight from Frankfurt to Prague was canceled by Condor for no reason. We were in time at the gate and we were unable to board second plane. In the cabin we had to pay for wine, headphones etc... The portions of the food in comparison to other airlines were terrible. I was hungry. Seats were uncomfortable. Again in comparison to other airlines. The planes was not cleaned... I am not choosing this airlines ever again.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "✅ Trip Verified |  I was declined check-in because daughter's passport was expiring less than 30 days before the return date (which is fair) so I agreed to get her return flight rebooked. As soon as I paid an extra $400 for the ticket changed I was told the cut-off time to check in has passed and I won't make it to the flight and that it can be rebooked again online but not at the counter. The agent refused to help further. Upon calling condor helpdesk I was told the flight can't be rebook at all, so not only did I end up paying for a ticket I wasn't able to use, I was also tricked into paying more for a change that didn't let me use this ticket.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "✅ Trip Verified |  I will never book with this airline again. A few minutes after checking in my suitcase, I was told that all flights were canceled due to snowfall. After 5 hours we were told that there would be no more flights. It can happen, this is force majeure. I called Condor several times, but each time they had no information about replacement flights or other solutions. I would receive a call back or an email. Neither happened. I could pick up my suitcase the next morning at 5:00 am. I also had to arrange a hotel myself, but due to the weather, no means of transport could be arranged and there was no other option than to sleep at the airport. We were given no drinks, food or blankets. It was too cold to sleep. The queues at the restaurants were 2 hours just to place an order. The next morning at 5:00 am I was at the baggage service desk, along with dozens of other passengers. The flights that day continued, but there was still no solution for my flight. It also turned out that the service desk only opened at 8:00 am instead of 5:00 am. So after waiting for 2 hours, an employee who knew nothing about it finally came. She had no idea about the canceled flights or our missing luggage. We had to fill out the baggage claim online and our suitcases would be sent after 2 to 3 days. It has now been 2.5 weeks and I have not received any responses from Condor. The only thing I get a response to is the baggage claim. They still haven't had time and I have to be patient. I don't even get an answer as to whether my suitcase is even still there. Worthless company. I would warn everyone not to book your flight with Condor. Ik boek nooit meer bij deze vliegmaatschappij. Enkele minuten nadat in mijn koffer had ingecheckt, werd verteld dat alle vluchten verlaat werden door de sneeuwval. Na 5 uur kregen wij te horen dat er geen vluchten meer zouden zijn. Kan gebeuren, dit is overmacht. Meerdere keren heb ik gebeld met Condor, maar elke keer hadden ze geen informatie over vervangende vluchten of andere oplossingen. Ik zou teruggebeld worden of een email ontvangen. Beide is niet gebeurd. Mijn koffer zou ik de volgende ochtend om 05:00 kunnen ophalen. Ook moest ik zelf een hotel regelen, maar door het weer was er geen vervoersmiddel te regelen en zat er niks anders op dan op het vliegveld te slapen. We kregen geen drinken, eten of dekentjes. Het was te koud om te kunnen slapen. De wachtrijen bij de restaurants waren 2 uur om alleen al een bestelling te plaatsen. De volgende ochtend om 05:00 stond ik bij de servicebalie voor de bagage, samen met tientallen andere passagiers. De vluchten die dag gingen door, maar voor mijn vlucht was nog steeds geen oplossing. Ook bleek de servicebalie pas om 08:00 open te gaan in plaats van 05:00. Dus na 2 uur wachten kwam eindelijk een medewerkster die nergens vanaf wist. Ze had geen idee over de geannuleerde vluchten of onze missende bagage. We moesten online de bagageclaim invullen en onze koffers zouden na 2 tot 3 dagen opgestuurd worden. Ondertussen ben ik 2,5 week verder en krijg ik geen reacties van Condor. Het enige waar ik reactie op krijg is de bagageclaim. Ze hebben nog steeds geen tijd gehad en ik moet geduld hebben. Ik krijg niet eens een antwoord of mijn koffer überhaupt nog daar is. Waardeloos bedrijf. Ik zou iedereen waarschuwen om niet bij Condor je vlucht te boeken.\n",
